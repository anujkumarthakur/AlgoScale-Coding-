1. ADD TWO --Problem:
	Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a
	specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and
	you may not use the same element twice.
	
	Solution-:
     		run ubuntu terminal - python3 solution1.py

2. RACE DIFFERENCE --Problem:
	Many people have participated in Algoscale&#39;s marathon. Everyone in the event has
	successfully completed the marathon except for ONE participant.
	Write a method with a signature findIncomplete(participant, completion) that returns the
	name of the participant who was in the participant array but is not in the completion
	array.

	Solution-:
     		run ubuntu terminal - python3 solution2.py

3. CAN PUT FLOWERS --Problem:
	Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are
	not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water
	and both would die.
	Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and
	1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without
	violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

	Solution-:
     		run ubuntu terminal - python3 solution3.py

4. MOUNTAINEER ARRAY --Problem:

	Given an array A of integers, return true if and only if it is a valid mountain array.
	Recall that A is a mountain array if and only if:
	
	Solution-:
		run ubuntu terminal - python3 solution4.py
